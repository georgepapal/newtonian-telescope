Newtonian Telescope Simulation

A simulation of a Newtonian telescope that I built, demonstrating how light rays reflect from a parabolic primary mirror, bounce off the secondary flat mirror, and finally reach the eyepiece.

This project aims to combine physics, geometry, and visualization to help understand the working principles of Newtonian telescopes.

🔭 Features

Simulation of light ray reflection on the primary parabolic mirror.

Visualization of the secondary diagonal mirror redirecting rays to the side.

Adjustable telescope parameters (mirror diameter, focal length, eyepiece position, etc.).

2D rendering of the optical path.

Easy-to-modify code for experimenting with different setups.


▶️ Usage

Run the main script:

python simulation.py


You can then adjust the parameters inside the to simulate different telescope designs.

📚 Background

A Newtonian telescope is a type of reflecting telescope invented by Isaac Newton.

It uses a concave parabolic primary mirror to gather light.

A flat secondary mirror reflects the light 90° to the side.

The observer looks through the eyepiece, which magnifies the image.

This simulation demonstrates these optical principles in action.

🛠️ Roadmap / Future Improvements

Add 3D visualization.

Implement different eyepiece lenses for magnification.

Improve ray-tracing accuracy.

Add GUI controls for parameters.
